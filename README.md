# WeatherTest

To create the database you must first run the server project,
run the initDB method.
After the true answer is returned, the database is created.
( It can be seen in the local SQLSERVER, DB called WeatherTestDB )
It is now possible to run the client project and access the server.

At the login to the site, you will be asked to enter a username.
If the username exists in the system, you can see your favorites.
If the username you entered does not exist in the system, the username will be added now, and when you add favorites they will be added to your username.

Example username in DB: Rachel123
